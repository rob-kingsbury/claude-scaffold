## SESSION START (REQUIRED)

**Before ANY work**, Claude MUST:

1. **Read context files:**
   - `.claude/context.md` - Project state, recent changes
   - `HANDOFF.md` - Current priorities (if exists)

2. **Check GitHub Issues:**
   ```bash
   gh issue list --state open --limit 10
   ```

3. **Output confirmation:**
   ```
   {{PROJECT_NAME}} ready. [X] open issues. Priority: Issue #XX
   Files loaded: context.md, HANDOFF.md
   ```

**DO NOT skip. DO NOT begin work without this confirmation.**

---

## COMMUNICATION STYLE

- Facts only. No fluff, no hedging, no praise.
- "I don't know" when uncertain.
- Disagree when the user is wrong.
- Research before building (check prior art).

---

## TODO = GITHUB ISSUE

When user says "todo", "add to backlog", "remember to":
- Create a GitHub Issue immediately
- Confirm: "Created Issue #XX: [title]"

---

## SESSION END (REQUIRED)

Before ending ANY session:

1. **Tasks → GitHub Issues** (incomplete work = new issue)
2. **Update context.md** (what was done)
3. **Clean workspace:**
   ```bash
   find . -type d \( -name "temp_*" -o -name "test_*" \) -not -path "./.git/*"
   find . -type d -empty -not -path "./.git/*"
   ```
4. **Commit and push**
5. **Tell user:** `Continue with Issue #XX`
